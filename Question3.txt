I believe that developing a user guide and a detailed video tutorial would be the best way to enable
the coaching staff to access the data analysis results. I would start by writing a step-by-step
user guide that shows how to execute the script. It would indicate where to input specific parameters
and explain how to interpret the results. I plan on including screeshots or just a screenshare while 
the recording is playing. In addition to the video tutorial, I would create an automated script to
simplify the process further. One way to achieve this could be to createa a configuration file so the 
coaching stagg could simply input their desired parameters so they wouldnt have to navigate the script.
